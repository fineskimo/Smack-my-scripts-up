# Smack-my-scripts-up
Collection of "as is" scripts for Blender 3D

This is a collection of small scripts I've used in 'one off' situations.

I will include details here od how to use.... and current limitations.

For the most part these are roughly coded and un commented.
I do intend to update these when I see fit to add better functionality\error checking etc

Multiobject_ChildOf.py :

  Creates a singlevert childOf constraints for all selected objects to the nearest vertex on the active object.
  Use in Object mode
  Requires manual deletion of vertex groups and contraints to rerun on the same selection.
